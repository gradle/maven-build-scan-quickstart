# Maven Build Scan™ quickstart

This is an example project that you can use to experience the [Build Scan™ service of Gradle Enterprise][gradle.com].

It is a small Java project that has the [Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension][manual] already applied.

## Create a Build Scan™

Follow these simple steps to create and publish a Build Scan™ on [scans.gradle.com][scans.gradle.com]:

1. Clone this project
1. Run `./mvnw clean test`

The build should end with something similar to:

Follow the link shown at the end of the build to view your Build Scan™ on [scans.gradle.com][scans.gradle.com].

## Experiment with Build Scans

Create different kinds of Build Scans by locally modifying this quickstart project. Here are some ideas:

- Edit `src/main/java/example/Example.java` to introduce compile errors
- Add more plugins and more projects

Alternatively, enable one of your own Maven builds to produce Build Scans by following the [step-by-step instructions][scans.gradle.com].

## Using Test Distribution

Test Distribution is enabled, but a [Gradle Enterprise server needs to be configured][getting_set_up] in order to use Test Distribution agents.
